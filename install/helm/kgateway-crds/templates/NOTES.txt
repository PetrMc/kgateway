Thank you for installing the {{ .Chart.Name }} chart.

This chart installs the Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) required by kgateway.

To verify that the CRDs have been installed:

  kubectl get crds | grep 'kgateway'

For more information on the installed CRDs, refer to the documentation:
https://github.com/kgateway-dev/kgateway

To uninstall the CRDs:

  helm uninstall {{ .Release.Name }} --namespace {{ .Release.Namespace }}

Note: The above command does not remove the Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) installed by this chart.
You may need to manually delete the CRDs if they are no longer needed. To do so, run:

  kubectl delete crd <crd-name>

Replace <crd-name> with the name of the CRD(s) you wish to delete. For example:

  kubectl delete crd kgatewayresources.kgateway.io
